# SpamTestNormandy
Created for Normandy Design Build Remodeling. Used as a phising/spam email quiz to discern spam mail from legitimate mail. Some resources are pulled from popular spam mail sites, others were pulled from Normandy employees' emails. The quiz is currently being worked on. 
The front end is based off the UrbanInstitute QuickQuiz template. The quiz questions are populated using JSON, but there's a bunch of js/css/html and python doing the work behind the scenes. Few edits to make quiz more professional were made.

NEXT THINGS TO UPDATE:
Show corrected email images; remove the popup and instead add in elements to the images where everything is highlighted.
